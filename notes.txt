Learnings

private static final Fields fields = FieldSelector.fields(CleansedHitFieldsSubSet.C9, CleansedHitFieldsSubSet.OMNITURE_EXCLUDED);
In the above this FieldSelector.fields is very important , it will allow you to create a group of fields  .

If you do Fields fields = new Fields(CleansedHitFieldsSubSet.C9, CleansedHitFieldsSubSet.OMNITURE_EXCLUDED); this will give an error

used Mockito to test code and verify() to test executions


2) Created AllMarketingSeo30DayRltTransform.java   that will transform a field

Learnings 
private static final Fields fields = FieldSelector.fields(CleansedHitFieldsSubSet.C9, CleansedHitFieldsSubSet.OMNITURE_EXCLUDED); made a mistake again , got to drill this into my head
try and see how plain vanilla cascading will work
